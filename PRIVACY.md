# Bastion Discord bot privacy policy

The software that drives operation of the Bastion Discord Bot ("Bastion") collects some data in the course of its operation. Some of that data is used by the people who operate Bastion ("the operators"). Here we seek to describe how data is collected and used by Bastion and the operators, so that you can decide if you are comfortable with the level of privacy involved in using Bastion.

When you invite Bastion to a Discord server, Bastion reads the name, ID, and member count of that server. This is recorded privately for the reference of the operators. Details about individual servers will not be shared with third parties.

If you are online in the same server as Bastion, publicly accessible information about your Discord profile may be stored in the "cache". The cache is a copy of some information that Discord provides so that Bastion can use that information without downloading it again. An example of the way Bastion uses this information would be to reply to a Slash Command with your username. Any information that is only in the cache is not accessed at will by the operators, and will automatically be deleted at regular intervals as a normal part of operation.

When you send a message in the same server as Bastion, publicly accessible details about that message, including its contents, may be stored in the cache. See the previous paragraph for an explanation of the cache.

When you use one of Bastion's Slash Commands, information about that command is saved in a database. This information is for the reference of the operators, or may be shared with third parties, e.g. to demonstrate how often Bastion is used. This information consists of the Discord IDs of the server, channel and user of the command, as well as the name of the command, and the arguments to the command, e.g. the name of the card that was searched for, in what language, etc. We assert that recording the user ID is necessary, e.g. for identifying abuse of Bastion. However, data shared with third parties will be anonymised.

When you send a message that includes a request to search for a card, information about that search is saved in a database. Like the above paragraph, this includes information about the server, channel and author of the message, as well as the name of the card searched for. However, the full contents of the message are not saved except in the cache, as explained above.
