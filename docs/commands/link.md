### Limitations

- Link names are only in English and may be unclear to speakers of other languages
- The output of many of the links is also in English and may not be helpful to speakers of other languages

## Next steps

In no particular order:

- We're always willing to add more useful links to this list should they arise.
- i18n of the link names may be difficult because the Discord Slash Command interface has poor native support for i18n.
- i18n support for the contents of the links may also be difficult, as the resources may not have a direct equivalent in another language.
