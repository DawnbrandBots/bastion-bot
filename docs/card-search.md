## Getting started

Simply enclose the name of the cards to search for in angle brackets `<>` as part of your
conversations to have Bastion fetch the card information for you! Example:

> I sometimes make typos. My favourite monsters are \<blue-eyes white dragon> and \<Dork Magician>. I can't believe \<GG EZ> is the name of a card!

![Search result for above message, part 1](./img/card-search-1.png)
![Search result for above message, part 2](./img/card-search-2.png)
![Search result for above message, part 3](./img/card-search-3.png)

This works in any type of channel, including forums, threads, and voice chats, as long as
Bastion is in the channel. A maximum of THREE cards can be fetched per message, to avoid spamming.

Bastion _must_ have all of its [permissions](/README.md#discord-permissions) to work properly.
If you do not want `<>` card search to be used in a channel, deny it the View Channel permission.

The card information is presented in the same Discord embeds as [`/search`](/docs/commands/search.md).
The embeds are localized to every official Yu-Gi-Oh! language. The default search and result language
for community servers is the server primary language in Discord settings, falling back to English if
the setting is not a Yu-Gi-Oh! language or it is not a community server. For more information, see
[Other languages](#searching-in-other-languages) below.

## Cleaning up

If the message summoning Bastion is deleted within five minutes, Bastion will automatically delete its
responses. This allows non-moderators to clean up after themselves.

## Searching by password and Konami ID

Like [`/search`](/docs/commands/search.md), you can look up cards by their
[password](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Password) (the number printed in the bottom-left corner) or
[Konami ID](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/List_of_cards_by_Konami_index_number_(4007%E2%80%935000)) (the ID assigned to the card in the [official card database](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/)).

If your search term is just a number, it will be treated as a password. Example:

> The smallest password is \<00002511>, but it used to be <10000>

![Search result for above message, part 1](./img/card-search-password-1.png)
![Search result for above message, part 2](./img/card-search-password-2.png)

If your search term starts with `%` and is followed by a number, it will be treated as a Konami ID. Example:

> The smallest Konami ID is \<%4007>

![Search result for above message](./img/card-search-konami-id.png)

Note: `#` cannot be used for either option because it conflicts with internal Discord syntax for channel mentions.

## Searching in other languages

Like [`/search`](/docs/commands/search.md), this uses the same [locale setting](/docs/commands/locale.md).
The search term between the brackets are treated as the configured language, and by default,
the results will be in that language.

To change the input language, add it at the end after a comma. The result language will still be the
configured language setting. Example:

> J'aime \<baguette du monde,fr>

![Search result for above message](./img/card-search-fr-default.png)

To change both the input language and result language, add both at the end, separated by commas, in
the order `<search term,input language,result language>`. Example:

> I wonder what the Japanese text is for \<blue-eyes white dragon,en,ja>

![Search result for above message](./img/card-search-en-ja.png)

For a full list of supported languages, see the above locale setting link.

## Rush Duel

Prefix or postfix the angle brackets with an `R` (case-insensitive) to search for Rush Duel cards
instead of OCG/TCG cards. `러` can also be used for Korean. Example:

> I Maximum Summon r\<Yggdrago the Sky Emperor>!

![Search result for above message](./img/card-search-rush.png)

You can freely mix search categories, but the maximum of three still applies. Example:

> \<pot of greed>R \<pot of greed> \<aleister the invoker>

![Search result for above message, part 1](./img/card-search-rush-mix-1.png)
![Search result for above message, part 2](./img/card-search-rush-mix-2.png)
![Search result for above message, part 3](./img/card-search-rush-mix-3.png)

If your search term is just a number, it will be treated as a Konami ID because Rush Duel cards do
not have passwords. Example:

> R\<15150>

![Search result for above message](./img/card-search-rush-konami-id.png)

Cross-language search works the same way. Example:

> 러\<푸른 눈의 백룡,ko> \<フュージョン,ja,ja>r

![Search result for above message](./img/card-search-rush-intl.png)

The `/rush-duel` command provides autocomplete on search and random selection.

## Appendix

### Where are TCG Speed Duel skills?

These were included in the old `<>` search somewhat by accident.
A Slash Command for skills is planned in [#446](https://github.com/DawnbrandBots/bastion-bot/issues/446).
If you have feedback, please [join the support server](https://discord.gg/4aFuPyuE96).

### When does the old bot still get triggered?

New `<>` card search runs on the new instance that also handles Slash Commands.
The old instance still handles some `<>` searches and legacy `.` chat commands.

`<>` will still trigger the old search functionality outside of threads and voice chats if the
search term contains `(` or `anime`. This is to redirect searches for unofficial cards to
the old bot, since they are not currently included in new Bastion's data.

Certain servers do not have new `<>` card search at all due to frequent
searching for unofficial cards.

### Custom brackets

Old Bastion had a niche feature for server administrators to change the brackets used for card search.
This was meant for conflict resolution with other bots and was very rarely used, and thus it is no
longer supported. A few legacy servers have their setting baked in, to be deprecated.
