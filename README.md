A free and open-source Discord bot for looking up cards and other useful information about the
_Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game_ and _Official Card Game_. This is the repository for the rewrite
to take advantage of new features offered by Discord and improve reliability.

Features implemented here will be gradually rolled out to the live bot. For documentation, please
refer to the old [Bastion Classic](https://github.com/AlphaKretin/bastion-bot) repository.
